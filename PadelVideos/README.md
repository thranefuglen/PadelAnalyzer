# Reference Videos Directory

This directory contains reference videos for comparison analysis.

## Current Files

- **Good slice.mp4** - Professional reference video for comparison
- **Bad Slice.mp4** - Default test video for demonstration
- **Single hit.mp4** - Alternative test video

## Reference Video

The reference video (`Good slice.mp4`) is used for comparing user uploads.

### Video Requirements

- Format: MP4
- Content: A professional padel slice shot filmed from behind
- Duration: 3-10 seconds recommended
- Quality: Clear view of the player's form and technique

## How It Works

1. The reference video (`Good slice.mp4`) is analyzed using the "Analyze Reference Video" button on the homepage
2. The system analyzes the professional technique and saves it
3. When users upload their videos, they'll see a comparison with this reference

## Test Videos

- **Bad Slice.mp4** - The default test video used when no video is uploaded
- **Single hit.mp4** - Alternative test video for demonstration and testing

## Note

The reference video analysis is **optional**. The application will work without it, but users won't get comparison metrics showing how their technique differs from the professional reference.
