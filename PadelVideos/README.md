# Reference Videos Directory

This directory should contain reference videos for comparison analysis.

## Required File

To use the reference video analysis feature, place a professional padel slice video here:

**Filename:** `Good Slice.mp4`

### Video Requirements

- Format: MP4
- Content: A professional padel slice shot filmed from behind
- Duration: 3-10 seconds recommended
- Quality: Clear view of the player's form and technique

## How It Works

1. Place your reference video (named `Good Slice.mp4`) in this directory
2. Use the "Analyze Reference Video" button on the homepage
3. The system will analyze the professional technique and save it
4. When users upload their videos, they'll see a comparison with this reference

## Note

The reference video analysis is **optional**. The application will work without it, but users won't get comparison metrics showing how their technique differs from the professional reference.
